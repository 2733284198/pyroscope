Pyroscope is an open source continuous profiling platform. It will help you:
* Find bottlenecks in your code
* Resolve issues with high CPU utilization
* Understand the call tree of your application
* Track changes over time

It is currently in active development and is a little rough around the edges. Give it a try and join [our Slack](https://pyroscope.io/slack) â€” we'd love to get some feedback and/or help you get started.

# Go Style Guide

## Guidelines

We use [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) as the general guideline.

## Project Structure

We use [golang-standards/project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) as the standard for where different parts of the system should go.

## Linting

We use [revive](https://github.com/mgechev/revive) for linting.

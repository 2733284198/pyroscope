# Go Style Guide

## Guidelines

We use [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) as a general guideline for Go code.

### Command Line Intefrace (CLI) Guide

We use [clig.dev](https://clig.dev/) guidelines when working on command line interface parts of Pyroscope.

## Project Structure

We use [golang-standards/project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) as the standard for where different parts of the system should go.

## Linting

We use [revive](https://github.com/mgechev/revive) for linting. We recommend that you use an editor integration. You can find more on that [here](/contribute/developer-guide.md#text-editors)
